Prepare the Data:
    ☐ Download the music playlists
    ☐ Move the music to the right folders
    ☐ Organize the playlists by genre
    ☐ Convert all the audio file to mono
    ☐ Resample the audio files to 8kHz
    ☐ Run the audio through pytorch's spectrogram feature
    ☐ Save the spectrograms in a dataframe each with a genre label
    ☐ Discover how to best store the spectrogram image for a CNN (may involve lots of experimentation)
    ☐ Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets

Train the Model:
    ☐ Create a few different models to train on my data. (CNN, NN, transformer (?))
        ☐ use hyperparameter tuning to find the best model


Reflect:
    ☐ How good of a model did I make?
    ☐ What challenges appeared?
