Plan
1. Prepare Data
    a. Download Music
    b. Move music to the right folders
    c. Use SciPy's spectogram feature to make a spectogram of each song.
    d. Store these specograms and the "genre" tag in a DF
    e. Create a method that will turn a spectogram from whatever format SciPy gives me into a tensor
    g. Make train, test, and validation sets

2. Train Models
    a. Create a CNN model to try and identify the song genre based on the spectogram image.
    b. use a conventional NN to the same end. See which works better
    c. look into using a transformer to detect genre
